GENERAL NOTES

This C99 library manages a set of user defined GNU style commands. The command
system controls the definition and the parsing of registered commands. Multi
syntax as well as completion of command arguments are supported. The effective
action of a command is performed by a callback invoked during command execution
after the completion of command parsing.

LICENSES

This library is released under the BSD license. The parsing of commands is
performed by the argtable2 library released under the LGPL-2 license
(http://argtable.sourceforge.net/)
