Manage a set of user defined GNU style commands. The command system controls
the definition and the parsing of registered commands. Multi syntax as well as
completion of command arguments are supported. The effective action of a
command is performed by a user defined callback invoked during command
execution.

is performed by the argtable2 library released under the LGPL-2 license
